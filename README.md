# Top-5-best-video-editing-apps

It is 3 am and I am surrounded with empty coffee cups and I am trying to turn my friend’s wedding footage into something that does not look like it was filmed on a potato. Does this sound familiar?

Let me share something real with you that I have spent last three months testing every video editing app I could get my hands on. Not because I am obsessed but because I was trying to find the perfect spot for editing app between “easy enough to use” and “powerful enough to make my videos pop.”

Why Should You Trust My Take?
Thats because I am not some tech guru sitting in a fancy studio but i am just someone who has made every editing mistake possible (like that one time I accidentally deleted an entire day footage — one pro tip: always have backup). So, after many hours of experimenting, finally I have some magical moments that I could say that I have discovered which apps or software actually deliver as far as newbie and professional is concerned.
